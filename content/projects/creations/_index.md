## Tupai (Operating system)

Tupai is a multitasking operating system targeting i386, amd64 and armv7 architectures. It focusses on safety, stability, portability and correctness. It is not designed with a specific application in mind, but rather to act as a base for future experiments in software safety. Tupai does not conform to an existing operating system API (i.e: POSIX) but instead aims to implement a new and innovative design.
