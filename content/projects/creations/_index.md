## Tupai (Operating system)

Tupai is a multitasking operating system written in Rust targeting i386, amd64 and armv7 architectures. It focusses on safety, stability, portability and correctness. It is not designed with a specific application in mind, but rather to act as a base for future experiments in software safety. Tupai does not conform to an existing operating system API (i.e: POSIX) but instead aims to implement a new and innovative design.

You can find more information about Tupai [here](https://www.github.com/tupai-os/).

## Euc (Software rendering library)

Euc is a versatile, simple to use library that allows 3D rendering on the CPU.
It has a portable, compact design that makes it perfect for prototyping ideas, unit testing, or even simple realtime applications.

## Funki Crab (Optimising BrainFuck compiler)

Funki Crab is an optimising Brainfuck compiler written in Rust.
It's capable of a large number of Brainfuck optimisation techniques and produces a significant speedup compared to naive compilation.

I created Funki Crab as an exercise in learning about compiler development, Immediate Representation (IR) techniques and optimisation.
Brainfuck struck me as a sensible language for such a project given its simplicity, Turing-completeness and wealth of potential optimisations.

Funki Crab is an anagram of Brainfuck. 'Crab' is a reference to Ferris, the Rust mascot.

## Veloren (Open-world, open-source voxel RPG and engine)

Veloren is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust. Veloren takes inspiration from games such as Cube World, Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress.
The game is currently under heavy development, but is playable.
At the moment you can explore the procedurally generated world in multiplayer mode and use basic text chat.
